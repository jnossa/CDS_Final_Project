The error "invalid command 'bdist_wheel'" suggests that the `wheel` package is not installed or not installed correctly. The `bdist_wheel` command is part of the `wheel` package, which is used for building wheel distributions.

You can install the `wheel` package using `pip`. Open a terminal or command prompt in your project's root directory and run:

```bash
pip install wheel
```

After installing the `wheel` package, try running the `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` command again.

Here's the sequence of commands being on the directory, for this case C:\Users\jaoss\Desktop\Data_Science\1st Term\Computing for Data Science\Libraries

```bash
# Install wheel package
--> pip install wheel

# Build distribution packages
--> python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

After this, you can proceed with installing your library using:

```bash
--> pip install .
```
